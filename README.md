# SWAPI Explorer

A Next.js and TypeScript app for browsing Star Wars data from SWAPI across all six main categories:

- `people`
- `planets`
- `films`
- `species`
- `starships`
- `vehicles`

The application uses the App Router, CSS Modules, category routes, and slug-based item detail pages.

## Live Features

- browse all six SWAPI categories
- search within the current category
- sort by `name` or `title`, depending on the category
- fetch the full paginated dataset for each category
- show loading, error, empty, and not-found states
- preserve recent category and per-category search/sort state
- show required transportation details for `vehicles` and `starships`

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping

## Route-Based Approach

I chose a route-based approach because the task required Next.js, where routing is a core strength. Each category has its own URL, and each item also has a dedicated detail route. This makes the app easier to navigate, revisit, and share, while also giving me a practical way to work with App Router concepts such as file-based routing, nested pages, layouts, and URL-driven state.

## Full Category Data

For the category pages, I updated the data fetching so the app does not stop at the first SWAPI response page. SWAPI returns list results in pages of 10 items, so I added a shared helper that keeps following the `next` link, collects all pages, and returns one full array to render. This means categories like planets now show the full dataset instead of only the first 10 results.

Example idea:

```ts
type SwapiListResponse<T> = {
  count: number
  next: string | null
  results: T[]
}

export async function fetchCategoryItems<T>(category: string) {
  const items: T[] = []
  let nextUrl: string | null = `https://swapi.dev/api/${category}/`

  while (nextUrl) {
    const response = await fetch(nextUrl)

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to fetch ${category}`)
    }

    const data = (await response.json()) as SwapiListResponse<T>
    items.push(...data.results)
    nextUrl = data.next
  }

  return items
}
```

## Sorting

I added a reusable sort control that stores the selected sort option in the URL query string. The category pages read that value and sort the results before rendering, using `title` for films and `name` for the other categories.

## Recent Category and Per-Category State

I added `localStorage` persistence so the app remembers the most recently viewed category, and also keeps search and sort state separately for each category. When the user comes back to a category page, that saved state is restored into the URL so the page shows the same filtered and sorted state as before.

## Slug-Based Detail Routes

For item detail routes, I used a slug-based URL approach so pages can have readable paths such as `/people/luke-skywalker`. One edge case with this approach is that some SWAPI values contain punctuation or special characters, for example `Yoda's species` or `TIE/LN starfighter`. To make those routes resolve reliably, I match the route slug against a slugified version of each item’s `name` or `title`, rather than trying to reconstruct the original string from the URL and search with that.

## Transportation Detail Fields

For the transportation categories, I added the required detail fields from the task brief on the `vehicles` and `starships` item pages. These pages show name, model, manufacturer, cost in credits, length, crew, passengers, and cargo capacity. I also extracted some of that repeated UI into reusable components to keep the code easier to read and maintain.

## Accessibility

I tried to keep the app aligned with basic WCAG 2.2 Level A and AA expectations. I added visible labels for form controls, visible keyboard focus states, larger interactive target areas, and clear loading, error, empty, and not-found states. I also kept the structure fairly simple so the pages are easier to navigate and understand.

## Error, Empty, Loading, and Not-Found States

I added separate UI states for loading, error, empty results, and unknown routes so the app always gives clear feedback instead of failing silently. This helped make the app easier to use and easier to reason about while building.

## Dynamic Routes Example

A separate dynamic-routing example is included under `src/examples/dynamic-routes/`.

It is not part of the live application route tree and does not affect the running app. I kept it as a learning/reference example to compare a dynamic route approach with the manually defined category routes used in the current implementation.

## Future Improvements

One of the next things I would like to improve is using more of the linked relationships provided by SWAPI. Many resources already reference each other through URLs, for example people are linked to films, homeworlds, vehicles, and starships. Building on those relationships would make the app feel more connected and would allow the detail pages to become richer and more useful.

## Prototype Exploration

To explore this further, I also prompted a small prototype using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used it to experiment with alternative ways of presenting and navigating related resources.

It is not part of the main solution, but it helped shape possible interaction ideas.

## Getting Started

## AI Usage

AI was used during implementation support, code review, debugging, and documentation. I especially used it to help think through pagination, slug matching, sorting, persistence, and some accessibility improvements. I still reviewed the code manually and adjusted the implementation as I went.
