# SWAPI Explorer

A small Next.js and TypeScript application for browsing, searching, and sorting Star Wars data from SWAPI.

## Overview

This project is being built as a frontend developer task with a deliberately simple approach.

The goal is to satisfy the acceptance criteria while keeping the code:

- easy to read
- easy to explain in an interview
- free from unnecessary abstractions

## Current Status

The project foundation is already in place:

- Next.js app scaffolded
- TypeScript configured
- App Router enabled
- global styles simplified
- default starter content removed
- project structure planned

The core SWAPI functionality is the next implementation step.

## Planned Features

The application is intended to support:

- selecting any available SWAPI category
- searching within the selected category
- fetching all SWAPI pages internally so the full dataset is available
- sorting by `name` or `title`, depending on the category
- clear loading and error states
- required transportation fields for `vehicles` and `starships`
- remembering the most recently searched category
- preserving search and sort state per category
- basic WCAG 2.2 Level A/AA expectations
- styling with CSS Modules

## Approach

This solution is intentionally kept simple:

- a single-page app on `/`
- no detail pages
- no route-based search page
- no React context unless clearly needed
- no unnecessary custom hooks
- no UI pagination
- minimal file structure

The idea is to keep the app practical and interview-friendly rather than over-architected.

The `components` and `lib` folders are the planned target structure for the main app implementation.

## File Responsibilities

### `src/app`

Next.js App Router files.

- `layout.tsx`
  Root HTML layout and page metadata.
- `page.tsx`
  Entry point for `/` and a thin wrapper around the main explorer component.
- `globals.css`
  Global reset and base styles.

### `src/components`

UI components for the application.

- `SwapiExplorer.tsx`
  Main feature component containing category selection, search, sort, loading, error, and persistence logic.
- `SwapiExplorer.module.css`
  Styles for the main explorer layout and controls.
- `ResultsTable.tsx`
  Table component for rendering category results.
- `ResultsTable.module.css`
  Styles for the results table.

### `src/lib`

Shared logic and app definitions.

- `constants.ts`
  Static values such as categories, labels, sort options, and storage keys.
- `swapi.ts`
  SWAPI fetch helpers that will fetch and combine all paginated results for a selected category.
- `types.ts`
  Shared TypeScript types for component props, state, and SWAPI data.

## Accessibility

The app is intended to cover basic WCAG 2.2 Level A/AA expectations through:

- semantic HTML
- labelled inputs
- visible focus states
- sufficient color contrast
- accessible table markup
- clear loading and error feedback

## Getting Started

## AI Usage

AI was used during planning, implementation guidance, and review.

All code and decisions are being kept intentionally simple and manually reviewed so the final solution remains easy to understand and explain.
